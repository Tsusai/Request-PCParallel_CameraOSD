Request-PCParallel_CameraOSD
============================

By Request:
Some CCTV Cameras have an On Screen Display (OSD) and physical button  
controls.  If the camera is modified and the physical buttons "extended"  
away from the camera for remote viewing and adjustments, why not control it  
with a computer?  Simply sends a High / 1 digital signal out of specific  
parallel port pins.  

Wiring information for Parallel communications:  
UP = D0  
DOWN = D1  
LEFT = D2  
RIGHT = D3  
CENTER = D4  

This program uses InpOut32 designed by Logix4U and  
[Highresolution Enterprises](http://www.highrez.co.uk/Downloads/InpOut32/default.htm) for Parallel communications
